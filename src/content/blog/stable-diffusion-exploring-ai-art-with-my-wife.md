## Stable Diffusion

In this post, I am excited to share some of the fantastic AI art creations I made using Stable Diffusion. These pieces feature me and my beautiful wife Jayme as the subjects and the results are truly one-of-a-kind and mesmerizing. The use of artificial intelligence in art is still a relatively new field, and I am always amazed by the unique and captivating outcomes that can be achieved through this medium. If you're into art or appreciate cool stuff, I hope you'll find these caricatures as interesting and unique as I do.
