        <h2 class="accent-blue">My Journey into Technology</h2>
        <p>
          For over 20 years, I've been delivering exceptional service within
          the IT industry, driven by my insatiable curiosity and commitment
          to innovation. I've always been captivated by the transformative
          power of technology—its ability to solve complex problems and open
          new doors of opportunity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, I hold the position of Internal Support Engineer at <a
            href="https://aunalytics.com/">Aunalytics</a
          >, an AI-powered data platform company based in the Midwest. My
          role spans Linux engineering, enterprise infrastructure support,
          and building automation and AI-driven tools that help teams work
          smarter and more efficiently.
        </p>

        <h2 class="accent-purple">Beyond the Professional Realm</h2>
        <p>
          When I'm not immersed in IT, I delve into various activities that
          fuel my curiosity and passion. I've been using the Linux operating
          system daily for over 19 years, reveling in the challenges of a
          terminal environment. I also explore the fascinating world of
          cryptocurrency, primarily focusing on $XRP and $XLM, and enjoy
          tinkering with AI tools for generating unique and intriguing
          projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of technology, I delight in exploring the rich flavors of
          craft beers - mainly double IPAs and robust stouts. As a
          self-proclaimed hot-wing connoisseur, I constantly search for the
          perfect spicy bite. My fondness for the Star Wars universe often
          occupies my free time as I eagerly discuss and dissect every
          detail of the franchise.

        <h2 class="accent-purple">Family and Community</h2>
        <p>
          Family is essential to me, and I'm blessed to have three
          incredible children and four delightful grandchildren who always
          amaze me with their boundless energy and zest for life. I'm also
          fortunate to share my life with my wonderful girlfriend and her
          three amazing kids, and being part of a blended family has added
          another deeply meaningful and joyful dimension to my life.
        </p>

        <p>
          I hail from South Bend, Indiana, a vibrant and dynamic city known
          for its rich history, strong sense of community, and diverse
          cultural offerings. I take pride in my roots and cherish the
          memories and experiences shaped by growing up in this beautiful and
          welcoming place.
